Game Overview
Welcome to The Land of Djakumba, an epic RPG experience set in a stunning archipelago off the southern coast of Africa.

Storyline
Over a thousand years ago, the Lumbari people settled on the island of Djakumba, dedicating their lives to the sea and living in harmony with nature. Their peaceful way of life was soon threatened as explorers and colonial powers sought to exploit Djakumba's treasures: its diamonds and strategic location. The Djakumbans, led by wise rulers like King Mwana Ngala and the fierce Queen Amara Zuberi, navigated these turbulent times with resilience, preserving their sovereignty and traditions. In The Land of Djakumba, you'll experience the island's rich history, from its sacred fishing rites to the victorious Great Sea Uprising.
